#  The program will use a loop. Also, after displaying score average (after dropping lowest score) , the program is to display a letter grade for the calculated average.


# Get number of items to purchase
numModules = int(input("How many scores do you want to enter? "))


# Empty list to hold valid responses
cart = []

# Loop to get the items
for score in range(numModules):
    grade = input(F"Enter grade #{score +1}: ")
    # Loop to ensure thisItem is in avaliableItems
    while grade < 0
        print("INVALID Score entered!!!!")
        print("Score should be between 0 and 100")
    # Add the valid item to the cart 
    cart.append(thisItem)

# Loop to print each item in the cart
print("Items we purchased are: ")
for product in cart:
    print(product)
